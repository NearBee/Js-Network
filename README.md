# Project 4 - Network
### Brief Description:  [Video Demo WIP]
In this project we were assigned the job of creating a social network with a slight similarity with twitter using primarily [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), though there is a little bit of (premade) [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

## All Posts:
The first view that a user (unregistered/registered) would see would be one that had all posts created by users that are already registered on the website, from here if the user is registered they could "Like" a post. (Also in the photos there is a light/dark mode, for the rest of the pictures I will be using dark mode)

## Changed Navbar (offset):
I took the liberty of changing the navbar from the plain top bar that was shown in prior projects to one that would involve a little more of a JavaScript look with a offset sidebar that hold all of the same information/links as the previous layout though with the addition of the Dark Mode/Light Mode button at the bottom to allow a user to freely switch between each mode.

## Profile Page:
When a user clicks the name of a post author in a post on any view (All posts, profile view, following view) they are brought to a page that would show all the posts by that user as well as the current amount of followers that the user and the amount of users the profile owner follows, if the current logged in user is not the profile owner the ability to follow/unfollow the user is also present at the center of the screen.

## Following Page:
From the navbar any logged in user is able to view a page that brings up all posts from users that the logged in user currently follows, there a user can like the post as well as go to the post author's profile page.

This was a fun project that was a bit of a challenge, but I am glad I had the opportunity to do it! Thank you for reading my README!
